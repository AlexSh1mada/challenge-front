# challenge-front
Front End Challenge

As it is evident I wasn't able to fully finish the challenge given that I had started it using a CSS framework without realizing there was a line in the document about not using frameworks, not sure how I skipped that line but turns out I did, thus resulting in me having to pretty much restart/rethink the way I intended to face the challenge with significantly less time, however I still want to present what I did in hopes that it's worth something, thank you for the opportunity and I hope you have a nice day!
